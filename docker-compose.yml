# Notes:
# - We intentionally map MySQL to host port 3307 to avoid conflicts with any local MySQL
#   instance that might already be listening on 3306 (common on Windows).
# - The `healthcheck` allows Docker to test when MySQL is ready. `depends_on` ensures
#   startup order but does not wait for readiness; the healthcheck helps but your app
#   should still use retry/backoff when connecting during startup.
